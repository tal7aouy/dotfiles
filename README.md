# Neovim
This is a public repo, that contains some settings and plugins that allows you to use NeoVim like Visual Studio Code.

#### You can clone the repository into your nvim folder, or enter the repository files, and copy only the settings you need

#### After that, you just have to open your `init.vim`, probably located at `/home/your_user/.config/nvim`, press `ESC`, and then type `:PlugInstall` to auto-detect the plugins and install them

#### To display the icons correctly, make sure your terminal is using a Nerd Font, here is the link to check the fonts: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#patched-fonts
